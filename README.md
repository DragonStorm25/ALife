## Goal

To create a particle simulation that runs on a modified version of physics and chemistry, with some inspiration taken from real life, than can model analogues to real life organic compounds, like phospholipids and amino acids. If analogues can be created and shown to perform similar functions, this would suggest our universes laws of physics and chemistry may not be the only ones that allow life to form.
